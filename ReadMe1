Medi Sync - A hospital based erp system 

Project Description: Most hospitals still rely on fragmented systems for managing patients, staff, billing, and pharmacy data. This leads to:
Long waiting times due to poor scheduling
Unavailable beds or mismanaged inventory
Inefficient use of staff and delayed decisions
