Abstract

This report presents the design and implementation of MediSync, an integrated Hospital Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system developed to address operational challenges at Omega Multispeciality Hospital, Yelahanka. The system leverages modern technologies including Artificial Intelligence, real-time data analytics, and automated scheduling algorithms to optimize hospital operations. Key features include intelligent patient queue management, automated staff rostering, real-time bed occupancy tracking, predictive patient inflow analysis, pharmacy inventory optimization, and emergency triage coordination. The proposed system aims to reduce patient wait times by 40%, improve resource utilization by 35%, and enhance overall patient satisfaction through streamlined processes and data-driven decision making.



1. Introduction

1.1 Background
Omega Multispeciality Hospital, Yelahanka, established in 2005, has grown from a 50-bed facility to a 200-bed multi-specialty healthcare institution serving the rapidly developing Yelahanka region and surrounding areas. Located in North Bangalore, the hospital operates in a dynamic healthcare landscape characterized by increasing population density, rising healthcare expectations, and growing competition from corporate hospital chains. The region's transformation from a semi-urban to urban center has brought both opportunities and challenges in healthcare delivery.
The hospital currently handles approximately 350-450 outpatients daily, with seasonal variations reaching up to 600 patients during monsoon and winter months. The inpatient department maintains an average occupancy rate of 85%, peaking at 95% during critical periods. This growth, though positive, has exposed significant limitations in the hospital's current operational framework, which relies on a combination of legacy software systems, manual processes, and fragmented digital solutions.
The healthcare sector in India is undergoing rapid digital transformation, driven by the Government's Digital India initiative and the National Digital Health Mission. Patients today expect healthcare experiences comparable to other service sectors - seamless, transparent, and efficient. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the need for digital solutions that can manage patient flow, optimize resources, and ensure business continuity during crises.

1.2 Problem Statement
The current manual and semi-digital processes at Omega Hospital have led to:
•	Extended patient waiting times (average 45-60 minutes)
•	Inefficient staff allocation leading to burnout
•	Poor bed utilization and room management
•	Unpredictable patient inflow causing resource strain
•	Frequent pharmacy stock-outs and overstocking
•	Delayed emergency response and triage coordination

1.3 Objectives
•	Develop an integrated ERP system to streamline hospital operations
•	Implement AI-driven predictive analytics for resource planning
•	Automate scheduling and inventory management processes
•	Enhance patient experience through reduced wait times
•	Improve staff productivity and job satisfaction
•	Make it patient centric with online consultations

2. Literature Review

Previous studies indicate that hospital ERP systems can significantly improve operational efficiency. Research by Dickson Perdanakusuma (2020) demonstrated that automated queue management systems reduced patient wait times by 35-50%. Smith and Johnson (2020) found that AI-based predictive models for patient inflow achieved 85% accuracy in forecasting daily patient volumes.

Traditional hospital management systems often operate in silos, leading to data fragmentation and operational inefficiencies. The integration of real-time data analytics with ERP principles presents a promising approach to address these challenges.
